Clean Energy Reports 104.6 Million Gallons Delivered and Revenue of $91.9 Million for the Fourth Quarter of 2021 NEWPORT BEACH Calif February 24 2022 BUSINESS WIRE Clean Energy Fuels Corp NASDAQ: CLNE Clean Energy or the Company today announced its operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 Andrew J Littlefair Clean Energys President and Chief Executive Officer stated Our fuel volumes continue to increase because of higher demand for RNG by Amazon large transit customers like New York City Metro and Los Angeles County Metro and other customers Not only is RNG a clean renewable fuel its incredibly practical for heavy duty vehicles which is driving demand As we explained in detail during our RNG Day presentation on January 26 our nation wide distribution business is extremely important in providing the infrastructure and access necessary to deliver and monetize RNG Despite the lingering effects of the pandemic 2021 turned out to be strategically one of the best years for the company as we expanded into RNG development and supply signed on a very important customer in Amazon and continued to lead the overall shift into clean transportation The Company delivered 1046 million gallons in the fourth quarter of 2021 a 9% increase from 960 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 This increase was principally from continued growth in Refuse Amazon and increased RNG deliveries into transit customers Renewable natural gas RNG delivered was 449 million gallons in the fourth quarter of 2021 a 9% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 The Companys revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $919 million an increase of 226% compared to $750 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 included non cash stock based sales incentive contra revenue charges Amazon warrant charges related to the warrant issued to Amazoncom NV Investment Holdings LLC the Amazon Warrant of $34 million Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 also included an unrealized loss of $13 million on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Companys Zero Now truck financing program compared to an unrealized loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 Excluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 257% to $966 million compared to $768 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 This increase in revenue was principally due to higher RIN and natural gas prices a favorable fuel price mix which is based on the variation of fuel types and locations where we deliver fuel and an increase in the number of gallons delivered partially offset by a reduction in station construction revenue related principally to delays in construction activities associated with the pandemic The Companys revenue for the year ended December 31 2021 was $2556 million a decrease of 124% compared to $2917 million for the year ended December 31 2020 Revenue for the year ended December 31 2021 included Amazon warrant charges of $836 million Revenue for the year ended December 31 2021 also included an unrealized loss of $35 million on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts relating to the Companys Zero Now truck financing program compared to an unrealized gain of $21 million for the year ended December 31 2020 Excluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized gains and losses revenue for the year ended December 31 2021 increased by 184% to $3428 million compared to $2896 million for the year ended December 31 2020 This increase in revenue was principally due to higher RIN and natural gas prices a favorable fuel price mix which is based on the variation of fuel types and locations where we deliver fuel and an increase in the number of gallons delivered partially offset by a reduction in station construction revenue related principally to delays in construction activities in the second half of 2021 associated with the pandemic On a GAAP as defined below basis net loss attributable to Clean Energy for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $24 million or $001 per share compared to $26 million or $001 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 the fourth quarter of 2021 was negatively affected by the Amazon warrant charges On a GAAP basis net loss attributable to Clean Energy for the year ended December 31 2021 was $931 million or $044 per share compared to $99 million or $005 per share for the year ended December 31 2020 The year ended December 31 2021 was negatively affected by the Amazon warrant charges and the unrealized loss on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts partially offset by gains from sale of natural gas commodity inventory at favorable market prices while the comparable 2020 period was positively affected by the unrealized gain on commodity swap and customer fueling contracts Non GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA each as defined below for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $003 and $180 million respectively Non GAAP loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $000 and $136 million respectively Non GAAP income per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31 2021 was $004 and $570 million respectively Non GAAP loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31 2020 was $004 and $451 million respectively Non GAAP income loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA are described below and reconciled to GAAP net income loss per share attributable to Clean Energy and GAAP net income loss attributable to Clean Energy respectively To supplement the Companys unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP the Company uses non GAAP financial measures that it calls non GAAP income loss per share non GAAP income loss per share and adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA Management presents non GAAP income loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes these measures provide meaningful supplemental information about the Companys performance for the following reasons: 1 these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Companys operating performance and make financial and operational decisions 2 these measures exclude the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Companys core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business and 3 these measures are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Companys business In future quarters the Company may adjust for other expenditures charges or gains to present non GAAP financial measures that the Companys management believes are indicative of the Companys core operating performance Non GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the Companys GAAP results The Company expects to continue reporting non GAAP financial measures adjusting for the items described below and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Companys management deems appropriate and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses charges or gains like the non GAAP adjustments described below Accordingly unless expressly stated otherwise the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual infrequent or non recurring Non GAAP income loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to GAAP income loss GAAP income loss per share or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance Moreover because not all companies use identical measures and calculations the Companys presentation of non GAAP income loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies Non GAAP income loss per share which the Company presents as a non GAAP measure of its performance is defined as net income loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp plus Amazon warrant charges plus stock based compensation expense plus minus loss income from the SAFE&CEC Srl equity method investment and plus minus any loss gain from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments the total of which is divided by the Companys weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis The Companys management believes excluding non cash expenses related to the Amazon warrant charges provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys performance because the Amazon warrant charges are measured based upon a fair value determined using a variety of assumptions and estimates and the Amazon warrant charges do not impact the Companys operating cash flows related to the delivery and sale of vehicle fuel to its customer The Companys management believes excluding non cash expenses related to stock based compensation provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys performance because of the varying available valuation methodologies the volatility of the expense which depends on market forces outside of managements control the subjectivity of the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use which may obscure trends in a companys core operating performance Similarly the Company believes excluding the non cash results from the SAFE&CEC Srl equity method investment is useful to investors because these charges are not part of or representative of the core operations of the Company In addition the Companys management believes excluding the non cash loss gain from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is useful to investors because the valuation of the derivative instruments is based on a number of subjective assumptions the amount of the loss or gain is derived from market forces outside of managements control and the exclusion of these amounts enables investors to compare the Companys performance with other companies that do not use or use different forms of derivative instruments The table below shows GAAP and non GAAP income loss attributable to Clean Energy per share and also reconciles GAAP net income loss attributable to Clean Energy to the non GAAP net income loss attributable to Clean Energy figure used in the calculation of non GAAP income loss per share: Adjusted EBITDA which the Company presents as a non GAAP measure of its performance is defined as net income loss attributable to Clean Energy plus minus income tax expense benefit plus interest expense minus interest income plus depreciation and amortization expense plus Amazon warrant charges plus stock based compensation expense plus minus loss income from the SAFE&CEC equity method investment and plus minus any loss gain from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments The Companys management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys performance for the same reasons discussed above with respect to non GAAP income loss per share In addition management internally uses Adjusted EBITDA to determine elements of executive and employee compensation The table below shows Adjusted EBITDA and also reconciles this figure to GAAP net income loss attributable to Clean Energy: The Company defines gallons delivered as its gallons sold as compressed natural gas CNG and liquefied natural gas LNG along with its gallons associated with providing operations and maintenance services in each case delivered to its customers in the applicable period plus the Companys proportionate share of gallons delivered by joint ventures in the applicable period RNG sold as vehicle fuel is included in the CNG or LNG amounts as applicable based on the form in which it was sold The table below shows gallons delivered for the three months and years ended December 31 2020 and 2021: The following table shows the Companys sources of revenue for the three months and years ended December 31 2020 and 2021: GAAP net loss for 2022 is expected to be approximately $57 million assuming no unrealized gains or losses on commodity swap and customer contracts relating to the Companys Zero Now truck financing program and including Amazon warrant charges estimated to be $44 million Changes in diesel and natural gas market conditions resulting in unrealized gains or losses on the Companys commodity swap and customer contracts relating to the Companys Zero Now truck financing program and significant variations in the vesting by Amazon of the Amazon warrants could significantly affect the Companys estimated GAAP net loss for 2022 Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 is estimated to be $65 million These expectations exclude the impact of any acquisitions divestitures new joint ventures transactions or other extraordinary events including a deterioration in slower or lack of any recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic Additionally the expectations regarding 2022 Adjusted EBITDA assumes the calculation of this non GAAP financial measure in the same manner as described above and adding back the estimated Amazon warrant charges described above and without adjustments for any other items that may arise during 2022 that management deems appropriate to exclude These expectations are forward looking statements and are qualified by the statement under Safe Harbor Statement below The Company will host an investor
