(Capital Market Research) (Weekly Market Outlook) Moodys Analytics and Moodys Investors Service maintain separate and independent economic forecasts This publication uses the  forecasts of Moodys Analytics Moodys Analytics markets and distributes all Moodys Capital Markets Research materials  Moodys Analytics does not provide investment advisory services or products For further detail please see the last page Cycle Fed Needs to Land the The US economy is flying through the different phases of the business cycle  we recently moved the economy from the recovery to expansion phase of the  business cycle This was partly based on Not everyone differentiates between recoveries and expansions and the two  terms are sometimes used defines any period from a trough to a peak as an expansion labeling the  remainder of the cycle a recession Many economists however use recovery to mean the  period just after a recession until real GDP surpasses its prerecession level However this is a rather narrow  definition GDP often recovers ahead of other indicators range of factors to determine when a recovery becomes an  expansion There are three phases of an expansion: early  mid  and late stage with the mid stage usually being the longest To  identify where we are in the expansion we used a K means clustering approach to spot patterns and map the economic  data It points toward an early stage expansion Considering the nature of the recession and the subsequent recovery odds are that the economy will likely continue to shift  through the different states of the business cycle more quickly than in the past Our baseline forecast is for what the Federal Reserve will do rather than what it should do Therefore odds are there will  be some material changes to our assumptions about monetary policy when we update the April baseline forecast Fed Chair Jerome Powells comments on Monday suggest  the Fed may not have any patience left and is set to accelerate the removal of monetary policy accommodation  Powell said “There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level” This caused financial markets to adjust their  expectations for the path of the target fed funds rate Markets now expect the fed funds rate to be 225% at the  end of this year a significant deviation from their Various measures of the yield curve continue to flatten  which will catch the Feds attention Lost in the debate about the yield curve is that the correlation between inversions and recessions doesnt imply causation The  inversion simply reflects the conditions that cause recessions—for example an overheating economy and  tighter monetary policy Therefore the Fed cannot lower the risk of recession by simply pausing its current tightening  cycle to avoid an inversion in the yield curve This could increase the odds of recession since delaying rate hikes would cause the economy to overheat more quickly Either  way the Fed is in an enormous bind Conditions in the US corporate bond market also could  appear soon on the Feds radar Recently investment grade noticeably albeit from very low levels However the speed  of the widening in US corporate bond spreads has caught our attention even though it is unlikely to have an immediate effect on monetary policy There have been  instances in past tightening cycles where wider spreads in the US corporate bond market caused the Fed to pause  The same likely holds today but the Feds tolerance now is for spreads significantly higher than they are right now Even with spreads widening US dollar denominated corporate bond issuance has held up well This should temper immediate concerns that wider spreads are going to  undermine businesses access to credit Corporate balance sheets remain strong and the forecast for defaults remains  favorable so the widening in corporate bond spreads may not ding issuance as much as some fear For now the Fed  will forge ahead with its aggressive tightening cycle An aggressive Fed is priced in by the bond market as are the odds of a policy error The current US Treasury futures  curve shows that the spread between the 10 year and two  year Treasury yields will invert in the next three to six  months The Treasury futures curve shows an inversion between the 10 year and three month Treasury yields in the next 12 months Markets believe a soft landing by the Fed is  unlikely We will keep a close eye on the yield curve For the five recessions we focused on the average number of months  between an inversion in the spread for 10 year and two year Treasury yields and a recession was 245 months However  a more troubling development than an inversion in the yield curve would be a steady rise in the unemployment rate or declines in employment over several months Both have  proven to be more accurate predictors of recessions and with shorter lead times than the yield curve If the unemployment rate begins to steadily increase in the  next 12 to 18 months that would significantly increase the risk of the US experiencing a bout of stagflation Tough to Handicap the US Outlook The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a significant blow to the global economy Its impact is magnified as the economy  continues grappling with the ongoing are conflating with already painfully high inflation caused by  the pandemic disruptions to supply chains and labor markets Inflation expectations were on the high side of  what is comfortable before the Russian invasion and now normalizing interest rates last week but has much more  work to do more quickly to ensure that high inflation does not become endemic How the near term economic outlook  unfolds critically depends on the path of the pandemic how the Russian invasion of Ukraine plays out and whether the  Fed is successful in calibrating monetary policy to these shocks and any other that may occur The most likely near term outlook—our baseline—remains economic recovery will evolve into a self  But recession is a serious threat 35% probability and  dreaded stagflation—high inflation and high probability While more of a stretch 5% probability  events could turn out better for the economy since there is Despite all the economy has had to deal with odds are that  the current economic recovery will evolve into a self  sustaining expansion That is by late this year the economy  will return to full employment This is consistent with an unemployment rate in the low 3s and an employment to  population ratio for prime age workers of over 80% Real  GDP growth will throttle back to the economys potential growth rate of near 2% Inflation should also moderate back to the Feds target of close to 2% but this will take longer until late 2023 For this sanguine outlook to come to pass  the pandemic must continue to fade—with each new wave of the virus less disruptive to the economy than the one before it—and the worst of the fallout from the Russian  invasion of Ukraine on oil and other commodity prices must be at hand It is critical that the Fed gets monetary policy  more or less right which means quickly normalizing interest rates over the next 18 months We also need to catch a break so that nothing else goes materially wrong for the  economy While worries about the pandemic—and precautionary efforts to contain the virus—have receded the economy is  still struggling with its fallout According to the Census Bureaus most recent pandemic focused Pulse survey from  early February close to 10 million workers said they were not working because they were either sick taking care of someone who was or fearful of getting sick This goes a long  way to explain the near record 11 million unfilled job positions a situation fanning wage and price pressures It  stands to reason that as the pandemic winds down people will get back to work positions will be filled and wage  growth will moderate Scrambled supply chains will also untangle easing shortages and prices Some of the worst bottlenecks have already been ironed out but things have  gotten more complicated with the re emergence of the virus in China and other parts of Asia  where most supply  chains begin and pandemic responses are more restrictive By itself the fallout of Russias invasion of Ukraine on the US economy should be modest American businesses and  financial institutions have links to Russia  but in part because of previously imposed sanctions on Russia resulting from its takeover of Crimea those links are not consequential The  principal link is through oil prices as Russia accounts for just over one tenth of global oil production including crude and  refined products and a similar share of global oil exports totaling 75 million barrels per day Prices have jumped more than $30 per barrel to over $100 since a Russian invasion  looked possible late last year This reflects the loss of approximately 3 million barrels a day of Russian oil due to  an explicit US ban on imports of Russian oil and self  sanctioning by global energy companies There is also a risk  premium in prices reflecting the possibility of even greater disruptions A handy rule of thumb is that every $10  per  barrel increase in oil prices results in a 30 cent increase in  the price of a gallon of regular unleaded costing the typical household $30 more per month to fill their tanks and costing households collectively about $35 billion more over  a year The Russian invasion has thus lifted gas prices by about $1 to a record $430 per gallon While that is a  financial hit to households cushioning the blow to the broader economy is that the US fossil fuel industry which vies with Saudi Arabia as the worlds largest benefits A $10   per barrel increase in the price of oil thus shaves only 01% from US real GDP growth over the subsequent year A $30   per barrel increase if sustained will reduce real GDP by This is our baseline outlook as we assume that Russia finds a  way to stand down from its invasion allowing hostilities to abate by this time next year and there are no greater  disruptions to Russian oil exports Oil prices average about $100 per barrel in coming months then come down as US  Saudi and UAE oil production increases in response Along  with greater global inventory drawdowns including releases from US and other nations strategic petroleum reserves  the missing Russian oil is replaced Of course Russias invasion of Ukraine could take any of a number of darker turns resulting in much more serious  economic consequences Indeed it is not difficult to envisage a scenario in which the conflict intensifies resulting in even stiffer sanctions on Russia  including a European ban  on Russian oil imports This would result in the loss of 54 million barrels a day of Russian oil which would take much  longer to replace and oil prices would spike even higher Oil prices closer to $150 per barrel would result for weeks if not  months pushing US gasoline prices to near $6 per gallon The previously provided rules of thumb would suggest that GDP growth this year would be reduced by 08% But this  surely understates the blow to the economy as the much higher oil prices and resulting inflation surge would  undermine already fragile consumer business and investor sentiment Inflation expectations already high could be completely dislodged The Federal Reserve faced with the  Hobsons choice of responding to the struggling economy or higher inflation would likely ultimately decide to rein in the  inflation and inflation expectations Policymakers will appropriately figure that it is better to risk a near term recession than stagflation which based on the debilitating  experience with stagflation in the 1970s and early 1980s can only be dealt with by a much more severe downturn As  long as Russia continues to pursue its invasion of Ukraine  recession and stagflation will be serious threats Whether the economic outlook will be characterized by a  self sustaining expansion recession or stagflation critically depends on whether the Fed is able to calibrate the normalization of interest rates That is raise rates fast  enough to sufficiently slow growth and quell inflation and inflation expectations but not so fast that it undermines  growth and the recovery This will be tricky Policymakers have much work to do to get rates up to where they need to  be consistent with unemployment inflation inflation expectations and financial conditions These are the measures in their so called reaction function which Fed  officials use to gauge where rates should be Based on our estimation of their reaction function the funds rate should  be 25% and the Fed should be engaged in quantitative tightening by allowing the Treasury and mortgage backed securities on its balance sheet to mature and prepay For  context 25% is policymakers estimate as well as our own of the so called equilibrium rate or r star—where the funds  rate should be in the long run To be sure the pandemic and uncertainty created by the Russian invasion are good  reasons why the Fed has been slow to begin normalizing policy But policymakers now need to work quickly—though not too quickly No wonder recession and stagflation risks  are so uncomfortably high A prescient gauge of the economic outlook is the shape of the Treasury yield curve The curve as measured by the difference between 10 year and two year Treasury yields has  been especially accurate in predicting future recessions Each time the curve has inverted in the past half century— meaning two year yields have risen above 10 year yields—a recession has soon followed The thought is that the two  year yield is a good barometer of what bond investors think the Fed is going to do with rates When investors believe the Fed will raise rates aggressively which will ultimately slow  growth and inflation they sell two year Treasuries pushing yields up and purchase 10 year Treasuries keeping a lid on  those yields When investors believe the Fed is going to push rates up too  quickly and tip the economy into recession the curve inverts Right now the curve remains positively sloped with  10 year yields higher than two year yields but not by much Of course the curve already reflects investor expectations that the Fed will aggressively raise rates and normalize them  by late 2023 This is similar to our baseline outlook Investors like us continue to believe in a self sustaining  economic expansion But also like us they believe recession Given all that has gone wrong over the two years since the  pandemic hit it feels somewhat pollyannaish to argue that there could be an upside surprise for the economy But there could be Little noticed is the seeming revival in productivity  growth to near its long run 2% per annum pace The shackles put on productivity growth since the financial crisis  have been broken and the bounce in business investment and business formations and the widespread adoption of  remote work during the pandemic augur well for even stronger productivity gains dead ahead There is no better antidote for stagflation than stronger productivity which  supports more growth and lower inflation Of course lots has to go right for this upside surprise to happen But we are  certainly due The Week Ahead in the Global Economy Well see a packed week for US economic data and any  comments by Fed official will have the potential to rattle financial markets The Fed is sending a clear signal that it may need to be more aggressive in removing monetary  policy accommodation A 50 basis point rate hike is on the table at the next couple of meetings if the data cooperate   The March employment report is due and early indications  are that job growth remains solid The unemployment rate likely will have dipped from 38% to 37% Even if March employment was a dud the Fed would likely look through  one month of data What will catch its attention are February headline and core PCE deflators Fed Chair Jerome  Powell is looking for a noticeable deceleration in month to  month growth in consumer prices but that likely didnt occur in February and will reaccelerate for March because of  the jump in global oil prices We also get the Conference Boards Consumer confidence index for March revisions to  fourth quarter GDP monthly personal income and spending The euro zones preliminary estimate of the March HICP will stand out in a busy week We expect inflation to jump to 7%  y/y this March from 59% in February Energy will be the main driver The military conflict in Ukraine has sent a shock to commodity prices which will show up first in the energy  segment and then pass to the food and core baskets Food prices will be growing strongly continuing an upward trend  predating the conflict as will those of core goods Services price growth will be relatively modest since we dont expect  a fuller recovery in the sector until this summer The conflict will also impose a shock to business and  consumer sentiment this month We foresee the euro zones Economic Sentiment Indicator dropping to 100 from 114  previously There will be hits to consumer industrial and to a lesser extent services sectors Each will be greatly concerned about inflation and industry will have an added  weight from a worsened view on inventories and supply not just to the conflict but also to lockdowns in China  Services  namely tourism may report weaker demand expectations given the absence of Russian tourist flows for the The euro zone unemployment rate was likely unchanged at  68% in February Germanys likely slid 01 ppt to 49% but we expect Italys was unchanged at 88% As infections from  the Omicron wave of the pandemic fell and countries began loosening social distancing measures we expect an uptick in  hiring by services in anticipation for a more conducive business environment Since the pandemic was not  completely out of the picture and we expect most post  pandemic demand to be oriented toward services retail  sales should grow tepidly for February In France  household consumption of goods likely rebounded 06% m/m after a prior 15% drop In Germany  retail sales growth likely  slowed to 05% m/m from 2% while in Spain we expect they stabilized with zero growth after pulling back in the  previous two months Russian retail sales likely grew 72% y/y in February  speeding up from the previous month The invasion of Ukraine will eventually weigh heavily on the Russian  economy but at the outset retail sales will be pushed up as consumers rushed to stockpile food and goods Regarding  the unemployment rate we are forecasting a small 01 ppt increase to 45% from the previous month not due to the invasion but to underlying weakness reflected in the  months PMI releases As for final estimates of fourth  quarter GDP in France and the UK  we are not expecting  changes from the preliminary estimates of 07% and 1% q/q respectively There is the risk however that consumption was lower than initially forecast For example there was a  slight downward revision to December retail sales in France  Japan will release a suite of indicators for February On  balance we expect a softening given the Omicron wave of COVID 19 subduing domestic demand the challenging  external outlook including higher commodity prices and the Januarys 13% fall We look for retail trade to fall 02% m/m in February after the 19% slump in January The pandemic  outlook has improved daily new infections have declined but lingering virus concerns and elevated hospitalisations  will weigh on near term household spending The unemployment rate likely held at 28% in February The Tankan survey diffusion index likely deteriorated to  2 in  March from 2 in December Weak domestic demand and higher commodity prices especially for energy have  clouded the outlook for manufacturers in the near term The Bank of Thailand will keep the policy rate steady at 05% Inflation hit a 13 year high in February at 53% y/y  amid higher energy costs Core CPI growth came in at more modest 18% The central bank is reluctant to begin basis points 4 bps wider than the 158 bps at this time last week and wider than the 136 bps average in February The by 3 bps to 147 It averaged 154 bps in February  The recent ICE BofA US high yield option adjusted bond spread is off its recent peak of 420 basis points as its now closer to 370 bps This is still well above that seen at the beginning of the year but the recent tightening is adjusted spread has bounced around recently and is currently 358 bps compared with the 386 bs this time last approximate what is suggested by the accompanying long  rose to 2% at the end of February from 18% in January In Europe  the default rate jumped to 21% from 12% Under rate will decline to 17% in the second quarter before rising to 28% at the end of February 2023 That rate would still be well below the long term average of 41% Our baseline forecasts assume that the US high yield spread will widen from about 400 basis points currently to 548 bps over the next four quarters This widening would be partially offset by improvement in the US unemployment rate which we assume will decline to 35% by the end of February 2023 from the current rate of 38% Our baseline forecasts are underpinned by positive factors such as good corporate fundamentals low refinancing risk in the near term and the transition of the global economy from a tentative recovery toward more stable growth bolstered by improvement in the COVID 19 health situation However risks have grown following the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Russia  Although we expect the Fed to raise interest rates at a pace that will not severely disrupt the US economic recovery and financing conditions the Russia   Ukraine conflict could add substantial risk to the default outlook through multiple channels especially in First quarter 2020s worldwide offerings of corporate bonds  revealed annual advances of 14% for IG and 19% for high  yield wherein US$ denominated offerings increased 45%  for IG and grew 12% for high yield bonds revealed annual surges of 69% for IG and 32% for  high yield wherein US$ denominated offerings increased 142% for IG and grew 45% for high yield Third quarter 2020s worldwide offerings of corporate  bonds revealed an annual decline of 6% for IG and an annual advance of 44% for high yield wherein US$  denominated offerings increased 12% for IG and soared  upward 56% for high yield bonds revealed an annual decline of 3% for IG and an  annual advance of 8% for high yield wherein US$  denominated offerings increased 16% for IG and 11% for  high yield revealed an annual decline of 4% for IG and an annual advance of 57% for high yield wherein US$ denominated  offerings sank 9% for IG and advanced 64% for high yield Issuance weakened in the second quarter of 2021 as worldwide offerings of corporate bonds revealed a year  over year decline of 35% for investment grade High yield issuance faired noticeably better in the second quarter Issuance softened in the third quarter of 2021 as worldwide  offerings of corporate bonds revealed a year over year decline of 5% for investment grade US denominated  corporate bond issuance also fell dropping 16% on a year  ago basis High yield issuance faired noticeably better in the Fourth quarter 2021s worldwide offerings of corporate  bonds fell 94% for investment grade High yield US$ denominated high yield corporate bond issuance fell from   $133 billion in the third quarter to $92 billion in the final three months of 2021 December was a disappointment for  high yield corporate bond issuance since it was 33% below its prior five year average for the month increase in the prior week This brings the year to date total  to $525 billion  Investment grade bond issuance rose $313 billion in the latest week bringing its year to date total to   $4275 billion  Total US$ denominated issuance is currently tracking that seen in 2018 and 2019 There were some adjustments to our forecast between the  February and March baselines as the latest incorporates new assumptions around the effect of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine  There are many scenarios on  how the Russian invasion of Ukraine will unfold each darker than the next but the most likely scenario is that Russian  troops will go no farther than Ukraine and any disruptions to oil natural gas and other commodity markets will be limited and temporary If so the impact of the Russian invasion on  the US economy will be on the margins The US banking and trade exposure to either Russia or Ukraine is very small The primary channels through which  the military conflict will adversely impact the US economy is oil prices and financial market conditions Europes  economy will be hit harder but its economic recovery will and for Ukraines economy this is a catastrophe Back Better” to “Building a Better America” Prior to Bidens  first State of the Union we revised our BBA assumptions in the March forecast We no longer assume Democrats pass a $12 trillion package of social safety net and climate policies  through budget reconciliation but rather a $600 billion legislation We jettisoned the following two provisions that  had been included in the February forecast: $400 billion in The BBA package would pass by the end of the third quarter with implementation starting in the fourth quarter It would center around $330 billion in clean energy tax credits and   $230 billion in direct federal spending to address climate change The reconciliation bill would also modestly expand  the Child Tax Credit by $40 billion by making it fully refundable on a permanent basis The BBA would be a  virtual nonevent for the economy in 2022 but its gross fiscal support would amount to 01% of GDP in 2023 peak at 025% in 2026 and settle at less than 02% by the end of  a 10 year budget horizon Because we have rolled back the number of BBA investments the March forecast also assumes a smaller  number of pay fors We removed the following offsets that were previously part of the February forecast: a new excise  tax applying to stock buybacks higher taxes on global intangible low taxed income for US multinationals and  other international tax changes The March forecast still includes the following changes to the personal tax code: ensuring high income business  owners pay either the 38% Medicare tax or the 38% net investment income tax and limiting business loss deductions  for noncorporate taxpayers In addition IRS funding would drug savings would solely come from repealing a Trump era  rule eliminating safe harbor from a federal anti kickback law for rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to health  plans and pharmacy benefit managers in Medicare Part D We do not assume Democrats implement other prescription drug reforms such as allowing the federal government to  negotiate drug prices in Medicare or requiring drug companies to pay rebates when annual increases in drug  prices for Medicare and private insurance exceed the rate of In sum the BBA would include $700 billion in tax increases  on well to do households as well as prescription drug savings As a result it would lead to a net deficit reduction of $100 billion over the next 10 years Our BBA assumption  in the March forecast is broadly in line with recent We adjusted our epidemiological assumptions to anticipate that total confirmed COVID 19 cases in the US will be 81  million less than the 829 million in the February baseline However the number of assumed cases is still well above that assumed before the Omicron variant The seven day  moving average of daily confirmed cases dropped sharply recently and was around 39000 below its recent peak of  807000 and among the lowest since July The date for abatement of the pandemic where total case growth is less than 005% per day changed slightly as it has already  occurred We had expected it to abate on April 4 We have replaced the concept of herd immunity with “effective immunity” which is a rolling number of infections  plus vaccinations to account for the fact that immunity is not permanent The forecast still assumes that COVID 19  will be endemic and seasonal The March baseline factors in the recent jump in energy prices and that led us to revise our forecast lower for US  GDP growth by 02 of a percentage point to 35% this year We nudged up the forecast for GDP growth in 2023 from  3% to 31% The bulk of the downward revision was in the second quarter when real GDP is expected to rise 48% at an annualized rate compared with the 61% in the February  baseline forecast We now expect oil prices to peak in the second quarter with West Texas Intermediate crude oil  prices averaging $100 per barrel Our rule of thumb is that every $10 increase in the per barrel price of oil increases US retail gasoline prices by 30 cents a gallon Every penny  increase in retail gasoline prices reduces consumer spending by about $15 billion over the course of a year GDP growth in the second half of this year will average 27%  at an annualized rate The Bloomberg consensus is for real GDP to increase 36% this year and 24% in 2023 Oil prices financial market conditions inventories and  global supply chain issues remain downside risks to the near term forecast While inventories played an enormous  role in the gain in fourth quarter GDP they are on track along with net exports to be a significant drag on growth early this year Our high frequency GDP models tracking  estimate of first quarter GDP growth keeps heading south but it has nothing to do with recent geopolitical events  Currently first quarter GDP is on track to rise 05% at an Fundamentals have turned less supportive for business  investment as corporate credit spreads continue to widen However corporate profit margins are fairly wide and banks  are easing lending standards We have real business equipment spending rising 73% this year compared with 82% in the February baseline The  forecast is for real business equipment spending to increase 56% in 2023 a touch stronger than the 54% gain in the Risks are weighted to the downside for nonenergy business investment as financial markets could tighten more than we anticipate and corporate credit spreads widen further The  correlation coefficient between monthly changes in the high yield corporate bond spread and changes in the S&P  500 is  071 since 2000 The relationship is still strong if we look at it on a weekly basis Using no and various lags the Granger causality tests showed changes in the S&P 500  caused changes in the high yield corporate bond spread The The real nonresidential structures investment is now  expected to increase 144% this year compared with the 11% gain in the February forecast Some of the upward  revision is the boost to business investment from higher wells The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses the American  Petroleum Institutes weighted average of footage drilled along with rotary rig counts from Baker Hughes in its current quarter estimate of private fixed investment in  mining exploration shafts and wells This segment now accounts for more than 10% of nominal private fixed  investment in nonresidential structures Therefore a rise in energy prices would lead to an increase in the number of was revised higher it is now expected to increase 86% this year compared with 52% in the February baseline We  raised the forecast next year from 2% to 77% Revisions to housing starts were small Housing starts are expected to be 181 million compared with 184 million in  the February baseline Revisions to housing starts next year were also modest Risks are heavily weighted to the  downside There are likely only so many homes that can be built each year because of labor supply constraints and lack of buildable lots Some of the labor supply issues will ease  as the pandemic winds down but the reduction in immigration is particularly problematic for homebuilders  ability to find workers Revisions to the forecast for new  and existing home sales this year were minor as mortgage rates havent risen either fast or high enough to cut  noticeably into sales We nudged up the forecast for the FHFA All Transactions House Price Index this year with it rising 115% compared  with 98% in the February baseline House price growth moderates noticeably in 2023 as prices are forecast to rise  23% a touch weaker than the 24% in the February baseline This is attributable to rebalancing of supply and The February employment data are incorporated into the March baseline forecast They led to minor tweaks to the  forecast We have job growth averaging 367000 per month this year compared with the February baseline forecast of  384000 There werent material changes to the forecast for the unemployment rate this year as it is still expected to average 34% in the final three months of this year and  34% in the fourth quarter of next year We assume a full employment economy is one with a 35% unemployment rate around a 625% labor force  participation rate and an 80% prime age employment to  population ratio All of these conditions will be met by late this year or early next Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was explicit during his semiannual testimony to the House Committee on Financial  Services He took away all uncertainty about the outcome of throwing his support behind a 25 basis point rate hike and  saying that plans to reduce the size of the balance sheet will Normally Fed chairs avoid tipping their hands as it could be  seen as front running the FOMC  However Russias invasion of Ukraine has caused a lot of volatility in financial markets  and created new uncertainty Therefore Powell likely wanted to reduce any uncertainty about the Feds intention at its upcoming meeting Powell did leave the door open for  larger rate hikes at future meetings He sounded optimistic that the Fed can engineer a soft landing where it raises interest rates enough to curb  inflation but not enough to tip the economy into recession Powell floated the idea that this tightening cycle will end  above his estimate of the neutral fed funds rate of 2% to We maintained our assumption that the Fed raises the target range for the fed funds rate four times this year 25  basis points each time Markets are pricing in more hikes just south of seven hikes over the next 12 months The  tightening in financial market conditions did some of the Feds work for it The primary channel through which  monetary policy impacts the economy is financial markets With financial market conditions tightening the Fed doesnt need to do as much this year The Fed is also expected to begin quantitative tightening  this summer That is the central bank will not replace the Treasury and mortgage securities it owns as they mature or  prepay allowing its balance sheet to slowly shrink and Risks are weighted toward more rate hikes this year Higher  energy prices are going to cause inflation to peak higher than we had previously expected We look for year over  year growth in the consumer price index to be 74% in the  first quarter compared with 7% in the February baseline The inflation forecast follows a similar trajectory as past  baseline forecasts just higher Inflation moderates through the remainder of the year returning to the Feds target in the first half of next year Key to this forecast is that oil  prices average $100 per barrel in the second quarter with that being the peak Also supply chain issues are expected  to ease leading to significant disinflation in goods prices We didnt make significant changes to the forecast for the 10 year Treasury yield The forecast is that the Dow Jones  Industrial Average incorporates the recent developments The new baseline will have the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower than its February baseline The recent decline  accounted for the bulk of the decline we expected to occur throughout the year Therefore the March baseline has  another leg lower in equity prices which we expect will remain within a tight range through the end of next year The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated inflation  across Europe and worsened an already elevated cost of  living crisis in Spain  Surging energy costs have triggered  protests by truck drivers fishermen and farmers who are all on the front line of rapidly increasing fuel prices Households and businesses across the country are also facing soaring  fuel and electricity bills The situation in Spain is among the most acute in the euro zone given the prevalence of variably  rated utility contracts in the country The government has already rolled over VAT cuts on utilities initially debuted last fall It plans to unveil another relief package on March  29 with more direct measures The government agreed this past Monday on an aid package of €500 million to help with  transporters fuel costs of measures on Thursday aimed at alleviating rising energy  costs These include a €300 rebate to all taxpayers and an taxes on fuels and a three month cost reduction for  monthly public transport tickets These come on top of similar measures announced a month ago the total of  which could cost around €30 billion there have not been The flash estimate of the euro zones March PMI beat our expectations The reading for the composite index slumped modestly to 545 from 555 in February We were not  expecting the surveys to signal a contraction in activity reflected by a below 50 reading but we did suspect the  reading might fall more significantly Ultimately with particularly for services The military conflict in Ukraine has  worsened global supply conditions though which had a worse effect on the manufacturing PMI That said services  and manufacturing surveys reported significant inflation pressures and faltering confidence The flash reading of the manufacturing survey fell to 57 from 582 previously while  the services reading inched lower to 548 from 555 The UKs composite PMI reading did even better falling just 02 percentage point to 597 in March The details of the survey were similar given the effects of the Russian invasion  of Ukraine on global supply conditions and prices However the services PMI increased during the month supported by a  wave of post pandemic demand The services PMI reading rose to 61 from 605 a month earlier while the manufacturing PMI fell to 555 from 58 previously The flash  readings for the euro zone and the UK support our view of continued stability in labor markets struggling output  despite resilient demand and a continued acceleration in inflation in the first quarter The Swiss National Bank maintained its policy rate at   075% at its March meeting The inflation rate rose above target to 22% y/y in February on the back of higher oil  prices and global supply bottlenecks The SNB upwardly revised its 2022 inflation forecast to 21% A strong franc is  mitigating inflation pressures however The monetary authority maintained its commitment to intervene in foreign exchange markets to limit appreciation The SNB  expects the inflation rate to fall back below target to 09% in 2023 and 2024 so the currently more expansionary  policy stance is still in line with the banks mandate for price a similar path for inflation expecting no rate hikes in the  short term The Norges Bank raised the sight deposit rate by 25 basis  points to 075% Policymakers are battling headline and core inflation both of which are above target as of the February release 37% y/y and 21% respectively Inflation pressures  on producers and consumers will remain strong in the form of elevated input and energy prices due to global supply  disruptions and the military conflict in Ukraine  But on top of this wage inflation has been stronger than anticipated  which has pushed up prospects for robust inflation in the medium term We expect policymakers will act on their guidance and respond with another rate hike in June the  banks forward guidance furthermore specified hikes culminating in a 25% policy rate by the end of 2023 Singapores headline inflation soared to 43% in February the  largest increase since February 2013 Much of the rise was due to an increase in car prices caused by higher taxes rather than supply chain issues Core inflation which excludes  accommodation and private transportation saw a slower rate of increase compared with the previous months reading  Prices of food and energy increased at a slower rate than in imports almost all of its fresh food and energy making it  highly susceptible to external shocks  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has pushed oil prices above $100 per barrel and we expect energy prices to stay high in  the first half of the year This should ease in the second half which will quell inflation pressures in countries including Singapore  Supply chain disruptions from the COVID 19  pandemic are ongoing as well Although most of the world has transitioned to living with the virus China is a notable  exception Several key Chinese cities such as Shenzhen were locked down because of COVID 19 outbreaks The country is unlikely to relax its stance against the virus in coming months  and this will weigh heavily on global supply chains inflation “could reach 3% by the middle of the year” before  easing in the latter half This will bring core inflation near the upper bound of the central banks projection of 2% to 3% Februarys CPI reading is the last before the MAS meets next  month With headline inflation exceeding the central banks projections for the fourth straight month we expect to see  further tightening of monetary policy at the April meeting by 16% over the year in February a 04 percentage point  increase from January After netting out the effect of one off increase of 16% in February This was expected because  demand side pressures were subdued by tightened social distancing measures designed to keep an outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID 19 in check There was reduced  demand in consumer services and the housing market The housing market plays an oversize role in Hong Kongs CPI  making up more than 40% of the current CPI basket and weaknesses in the housing market which saw a 03% decrease over the year will lead to softer CPI increases  overall  However prices increased in other categories Clothing and footwear saw the biggest spike over the year at 8% while  transport and food prices increased 8% and 36% respectively Even though the headline inflation rate is relatively low compared with regional peers such as   Singapore and Taiwan  Hong Kong has not been immune to the inflation tailwinds caused by climbing commodity and  energy prices Hong Kongs zero COVID policy has put significant strain on  its healthcare system as the city deals with its worst virus surge However Hong Kong has seen a steep decline in new  cases since early March Officials are looking to gradually lift Still there are headwinds to inflation The housing market is expected to remain subdued in the near term as demand  from Mainland China is expected to remain soft for 2022 a reopening with China is still in the works with no set date at  the time of writing We also see interest rate normalisation by US Federal Reserve increasing borrowing costs within Hong Kong  borrowing rates in Hong Kong largely reflect  those in the US due to the hard currency peg This will reduce consumption activity and keep overall consumer  inflation slow We currently expect the annual inflation rate US corporate credit quality improved in the latest period with credit upgrades accounting for nearly two thirds of  changes and 60% of the affected debt The changes spanned a diverse set of industrial groups with investment  grade firms accounting for three of the seven upgrades Endeavor Energy Resources LP was the largest change in to Ba2 from Ba3 raised its Corporate Family Rating to Ba1  from Ba2 and revised the outlook to stable from positive The upgrade reflects Endeavors increased scale reduced  debt balance and our expectation of continued growth and Meanwhile Toll Road Investors Partnership II LP and Jets  Stadium Development LLC both received an upgrade on Investors Service lowered TPC Group Incs first lien priming  notes to B3 from B2 first lien notes to Caa3 from Caa2 and its CFR to Caa3 from Caa1 The downgrade follows TPCs  forbearance agreement in early February after a missed interest payment The CFR downgrade to Caa3 reflects the  fact that in bankruptcy noteholders could be required to take a meaningful haircut to outstanding debt at TPC given  the uncertainty over future cash outflows related to the explosion and fire at TPCs Port Neches facility in November 2019 It also reflects Moodys view of an average recovery on  TPCs debt given the value of the business and the potential proceeds from its insurance policies While the companys  financial performance has been unusually weak since the due to higher C4 Processing volumes owing to ongoing  improvements at its facilities and increased profitability in Ratings activity was once

Trying to Play Catch-Up (Capital Market Research) (Weekly Market Outlook) Moodys Analytics and Moodys Investors Service maintain separate and independent economic forecasts This publication uses the

further detail please see the last page As widely expected the Fed made its the target range for the fed funds rate  by 25 basis points and signaling that ongoing rate hikes are likely appropriate  The dot plot suggested a more aggressive tightening cycle than what is in our baseline forecast but we dont  put a lot of stock in the dot plot beyond the current year because there is  significant uncertainty in the outlook and the Feds view of the appropriate  path for the fed funds rate can change Also the dot plot has a shaky track record The dot plot in 2013 and 2014  showed an earlier increase in the target range for the fed funds rate than  actually occurred Even after the Fed began raising rates in late 2015 the dot  plot overstated the aggressiveness of There were not many surprises in the post meeting statement as the central bank described job gains as strong and inflation as elevated It noted that elevated inflation  reflects supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures Some of these including the pandemic and higher energy  prices are temporary but broader price pressures that may prove stickier and highlight the Feds growing nerves about the inflation outlook The Fed also removed the reference  that the path of the economy depends on the pandemic There werent any new details about the Feds plan for reducing the size of its balance sheet which Powell signaled would be the case when he testified earlier this month However the statement did say that the committee expects to begin reducing the size of  the central banks balance sheet at a “coming meeting” There was one dissent by St Louis Fed President James Bullard  who favored a 50 basis point rate hike This dissent isnt surprising as he has been lobbying for a more aggressive initial move for a while but the military conflict between   Russia and Ukraine took that off the table as financial market conditions have tightened doing some of the Feds  work The statement said the “invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship” It also  said that the implications for the US economy are “highly uncertain” but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on  inflation and weigh on economic activity The Fed updated its Summary of Economic Projections It cut the forecast for  GDP growth this year from 4% to 28% There was no change to the forecast for GDP growth in 2023 and 2024 and the Fed kept its estimate of potential GDP growth at  18% There were no changes to the forecast for what the unemployment rate will average in the fourth quarter of this  year and next both remaining at 35% The Fed nudged up the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2024 from  35% to 36% As expected the Fed raised its inflation forecasts for this year Year over year growth in the headline PCE deflator this year is now expected to be 43% compared with 26% in  the December Summary of Economic Projections The Fed also revised the forecast for inflation next year by 04  percentage point to 27% There was also a material upward revision to growth in the core PCE deflator this year raising  it from 27% to 41% The Fed expects core inflation to get closer to its target next year but is above its 2% target throughout the forecast horizon of the Summary of  Economic Projections The yield curve flattened after the release of the post  meeting statement and new Summary of Economic  Projections The bond market is skeptical that the Fed can address high inflation without upending the economy The  Fed will want to avoid inverting the yield curve Though there are reasons to be skeptical about the message that comes from the yield curve there is potentially a  psychological impact ahead of the yield curve inverting before a recession Most of our probability of recession  models suggest that the odds of a recession in the next 12 The flattening in the yield curve could limit how much the  Fed raises the target range for the fed funds rate since it will not want to invert the yield curve The Fed has options It  could opt to allow the balance to decline which is a form of on long term rates The statement suggested that the  balance sheet will start to decline at an upcoming meeting We are going to need to adjust our assumptions about the path of the fed funds rate The forecast is for what the Fed  will do not what it should do Inflation isnt going to moderate as quickly because of recent increases in global oil  prices An easing in US supply chain stress is critical to the outlook for inflation to moderate but new potential issues have emerged that may cause supply chain issues to  intensify China is dealing with a wave of COVID 19 and the country has a zero tolerance policy This lends additional  upside risk to near term inflation Therefore the Fed will remain laser focused on getting inflation down The March baseline forecast has four rate hikes this year but  it would likely be appropriate to add an additional one or two Powell said in his post meeting statement that there e “seven remaining meetings and theres seven rate Powell knows the Fed is behind the curve and will need to catch up which is a trick to do without undermining  the economy Also financial market conditions have and will likely continue to tighten This will do some of the All told the Fed is embarking on a fairly aggressive tightening cycle and it will be difficult to engineer a soft landing In fact it appears the Fed has some doubts that it  will pull it off as it expects a small increase in the unemployment rate in 2024 Historically an increase in the  unemployment rate of 30 basis points on a three month Energy Shock: The Good the Bad and the Ugly Russias invasion of Ukraine could cause a recession The principal channel through which it impedes the global  economy is energy prices Every recession in the past 50 years has been preceded by an oil price spike and it is déjà vu all over again Brent crude oil hit an intraday high of $139  per barrel before retreating to $100 per barrel as peace talks We have constructed three economic scenarios based on potential paths that the military conflict in Ukraine could take The good scenario is our baseline forecast in which  Russias invasion ends by this spring and oil prices retreat to $84 by the end of this year US gasoline prices retreat  below $4 per gallon The bad scenario is a Limited Disruption scenario in which the military conflict drags into  2023 and oil prices remain above $100 for the rest of the year Gas prices stay above $4  The ugly scenario is one in which Moscow escalates its military assault forcing the  West to ban Russian energy imports In that scenario gas Every $1 increase in the price of oil costs US consumers $3 billion over the course of a year While consumers are  expected to pay $70 billion more for energy this year under the good scenario they could pay $150 billion more in the ugly scenario That alone could mean the difference  between a 27% economy and a 195% economy The damage would be far greater in this scenario when  considering the impact on sentiment financial markets inflation expectations and monetary policy The Fed is expected to raise interest rates at least three times this year  to combat inflation Overreacting could cause a recession now but not taming inflation could cause a recession later  A protracted military conflict would seriously complicate the Feds ability to fulfill its charter which is to deliver  maximum employment at stable prices How much will Russian output decrease? In all three of our scenarios fewer Russian barrels of oil are available to the global oil market The hit to global supply is  1 million barrels per day in the good scenario 2 million bpd in the bad scenario and 3 million bpd in the ugly scenario  There are three principal channels through which Russian oil The first of these channels is explicit export bans The US    UK and Canada have banned Russian energy imports reducing demand for oil by 383000 bpd Europe is opposed to a Russian energy ban which is understandable given its  high reliance on it[2] While Russia accounts for just 8% of US oil and product imports a third of Europes oil and 40%  of its natural gas comes from Russia  Europe is already paying 10 times more for natural gas than it did a year ago  The US is quickly stepping up its capacity to export liquefied natural gas it became the largest LNG exporter in the world in January and two thirds of this arrives in Europe   but the USs displacement of Russia cannot happen Even though Europe hasnt banned Russian imports much  of its private sector is effectively self sanctioning This is the second channel Companies are deciding that they do not  want the reputational risk that they would assume if they bought Russian oil This is highlighted by Shell  which announced a large purchase of Russian oil before facing a  public backlash that caused it to reverse course and cancel The third channel is reductions in Russias capacity to  produce oil and gas BP Shell  Exxon and Total are among the Western oil giants that have exited their Russian  investments or canceled joint ventures with Russian energy companies These decisions in tandem with severe financial  sanctions that the West has levied upon Russia  such as barring most of its banks from the SWIFT financial network will choke Russian energy companies Without financing  they will not be able to invest in new wells needed to offset depletion of their existing wells Moreover many of the  products that Russia needs to refine its oil are produced only in Europe  and Europe has banned the export of these  products to Russia  A lack of financing and critical imports will reduce Russias capacity to even produce oil and oil products let alone export them We estimate that in the baseline scenario 16 million bpd of  Russias 72 million bpd of oil and refined product exports would be displaced More severe self sanctioning raises this  figure to 32 million bpd in the Limited Disruption scenario In the Lengthy Conflict scenario all countries that have  levied economic sanctions on Russia in response to its million bpd That would push oil prices to $150 per barrel  see Table 1 This loss of supply would be offset by three Russian exports rerouted from the West to more favorable countries such as China These offsets would help to limit the fallout on oil prices  see Table 2 But the world would still need more oil Where will oil come from? In all scenarios the withdrawal of Russian barrels from the  international market would be met by a combination of inventory depletion and increased production by the US    Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates see Table 3 No producer can increase production faster than OPEC  and Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold 82% of the cartels  immediate spare capacity The US has the fastest capacity to respond outside of OPEC  and it is also the worlds  marginal producer The greater price signal in the two Still should the invasion drag into 2023 there is a good chance that the world will have to dip into its oil reserves to satisfy demand The good news is that inventories are sturdy  enough to hold up even in the Lengthy Conflict scenario There are about 37 billion barrels of commercial crude oil  stored across the world around 23 billion barrels in global barrels of oil product inventories Even if the world were to  run a deficit of 2 million bpd this year as it did in 2021 when the global economy recovered from COVID 19 global oil  inventories would only fall from 8 billion to 7 billion barrels After playing a long and delicate geopolitical dance Iran has signaled it is prepared to re enter into a nuclear deal with  the US The US has long cultivated such a deal but it was not apparent that Iran was a willing partner until the past  two weeks Iran has already adjusted to economic sanctions If it were to strike a deal with President Biden it would risk  another painful adjustment should a Republican president hard one to make but it appears to have opted for  diplomacy Striking a deal with Iran would deliver the US a trump card that would substantially offset the rise in oil prices caused by Russias military assault Saudi Arabia has already begun to  signal its displeasure but it would be difficult to envision the Kingdom withholding barrels as Iran came on line as it would  be effectively surrendering market share If a deal is struck soon Iranian barrels would start hitting the market in the third quarter Iran is capable of exporting up to 25 million bpd  of oil and products It is the only producer large enough to fill the void of Russias withdrawal The alternative should Putin  decide not to back down would be inventory depletion $100 The Week Ahead in the Global Economy It will be a fairly quiet week on the US economic data front  Among the key data released will be new home sales durable goods orders and the final March University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey Since US consumers  dont like higher gasoline prices consumer confidence fell for the third straight month and for five of the last six  months to another cyclical low in March as gasoline prices continued to rise and the stock market kept falling  according to the preliminary report from the University of Michigan Its sentiment index fell to 597 in March from 628 in February The drop was led by expectations We  dont anticipate a noticeable improvement in the final estimate for March New home sales and durable goods  could have implications for first quarter GDP growth We expect the UKs consumer price inflation rate sped up  to 57% year over year in February from 55% in January This will be the result of stronger core inflation and energy  prices Core inflation will be supported by a boost in demand for services and goods following the retraction of pandemic  era social distancing measures at the end of January Energy  prices remain somewhat contained by the countrys electric and gas price cap but this will be recalculated in April and  provide a massive impulse Retail sales likely tracked another gain in February 07% month over month adding to the solid 19% rise in January Sales will have been supported by  the easing of social distancing measures  Russias industrial production was likely up by 8% year over year in February slowing from the 86% rise in January The  effects from the military conflict in Ukraine will not show up yet in the February release In March however we are report a downward revision to the growth rate to 18%  quarter over quarter rather than 2% This comes as retail sales were revised considerably lower in December Private  consumption as a result was likely even weaker than  Finally we expect the number of job seekers in France fell to 295 million in February from 298 million in January With  the recovery from the pandemic in progress we foresee gains to employment during the month The Philippine central bank will keep its policy rate steady at 2% at its March meeting Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has some added breathing space to keep rates on hold because  inflation has cooled from its August peak of 44% year over year In February headline CPI growth was 3% unchanged  from Januarys pace The central bank is keeping a close watch on inflation expectations Russias invasion of Ukraine  has heightened upside risks from high global energy and in the September quarter Movement restrictions to slow  the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID 19 have hurt domestic demand in the opening months of 2022 Hong Kongs inflation likely remained relatively subdued in  February at 16% year over year after Januarys 12% Movement controls aimed at slowing Omicron infections  are suppressing demand side pressures particularly for consumer services The subdued housing market is also dragging on price growth particularly given its relatively  large weighting in the CPI basket overwhelming the pass basis points 6 bps wider than the 152 bps at this time last week and wider than the 136 bps average in February The by 7 bps to 144 It averaged 154 bps in February  The recent ICE BofA US high yield option adjusted bond spread widened from 394 to 421 bps The Bloomberg around recently and is currently 386 bps compared with 384 at this time last week The high yield option adjusted bond spreads approximate what is suggested by the spread and that implied by a VIX of 27 rose to 2% at the end of February from 18% in January In Europe  the default rate jumped to 21% from 12% Under rate will decline to 17% in the second quarter before rising to 28% at the end of February 2023 That rate would still be well below the long term average of 41% Our baseline forecasts assume that the US high yield spread will widen from about 400 basis points currently to 548 bps over the next four quarters This widening would be partially offset by improvement in the US unemployment rate which we assume will decline to 35% by the end of February 2023 from the current rate of 38% Our baseline forecasts are underpinned by positive factors such as good corporate fundamentals low refinancing risk in the near term and the transition of the global economy from a tentative recovery toward more stable growth bolstered by improvement in the COVID 19 health situation However risks have grown following the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Russia  Although we expect the Fed to raise interest rates at a pace that will not severely disrupt the US economic recovery and financing conditions the Russia   Ukraine conflict could add substantial risk to the default outlook through multiple channels especially in First quarter 2020s worldwide offerings of corporate bonds  revealed annual advances of 14% for IG and 19% for high  yield wherein US$ denominated offerings increased 45%  for IG and grew 12% for high yield Second quarter 2020s worldwide offerings of corporate  bonds revealed annual surges of 69% for IG and 32% for high yield wherein US$ denominated offerings

issuance is currently  tracking that seen in 2018 and 2019 There were some adjustments to our forecast between the  February and March baselines as the latest incorporates new assumptions around the effect of the military conflict  between Russia and Ukraine  There are many scenarios on how the Russian invasion of Ukraine will unfold each darker than the next but the most likely scenario is that Russian  troops will go no farther than Ukraine and any disruptions to oil natural gas and other commodity markets will be limited  and temporary If so the impact of the Russian invasion on the US economy will be on the margins The US banking and trade exposure to either Russia or   Ukraine is very small The primary channels through which the military conflict will adversely impact the US economy is oil prices and financial market conditions Europes  economy will be hit harder but its economic recovery will continue Russia  however will suffer a debilitating recession  and for Ukraines economy this is a catastrophe Back Better” to “Building a Better America” Prior to Bidens  first State of the Union we revised our BBA assumptions in the March forecast We no longer assume Democrats pass a   $12 trillion package of social safety net and climate policies through budget reconciliation but rather a $600 billion  legislation We jettisoned the following two provisions that had been included in the February forecast: $400 billion in The BBA package would pass by the end of the third quarter with implementation starting in the fourth quarter It would  center around $330 billion in clean energy tax credits and $230 billion in direct federal spending to address climate  change The reconciliation bill would also modestly expand the Child Tax Credit by $40 billion by making it fully refundable on a permanent basis The BBA would be a  virtual nonevent for the economy in 2022 but its gross fiscal support would amount to 01% of GDP in 2023 peak  at 025% in 2026 and settle at less than 02% by the end of Because we have rolled back the number of BBA  investments the March forecast also assumes a smaller number of pay fors We removed the following offsets that were previously part of the February forecast: a new excise  tax applying to stock buybacks higher taxes on global intangible low taxed income for US multinationals and  other international tax changes The March forecast still includes the following changes to the personal tax code: ensuring high income business  owners pay either the 38% Medicare tax or the 38% net investment income tax and limiting business loss deductions  for noncorporate taxpayers In addition IRS funding would increase to improve tax compliance Finally prescription  drug savings would solely come from repealing a Trump era for rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to health  plans and pharmacy benefit managers in Medicare Part D We do not assume Democrats implement other prescription  drug reforms such as allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices in Medicare or requiring drug  companies to pay rebates when annual increases in drug prices for Medicare and private insurance exceed the rate of In sum the BBA would include $700 billion in tax increases  on well to do households as well as prescription drug savings As a result it would lead to a net deficit reduction  of $100 billion over the next 10 years Our BBA assumption in the March forecast is broadly in line with recent  comments by Senator Joe Manchin We adjusted our epidemiological assumptions to anticipate that total confirmed COVID 19 cases in the US will be 81  million less than the 829 million in the February baseline However the number of assumed cases is still well above  that assumed before the Omicron variant The seven day recently and was around 39000 below its recent peak of  807000 and among the lowest since July The date for abatement of the pandemic where total case growth is less  than 005% per day changed slightly as it has already occurred We had expected it to abate on April 4 We have replaced the concept of herd immunity with  “effective immunity” which is a rolling number of infections plus vaccinations to account for the fact that immunity is not permanent The forecast still assumes that COVID 19  will be endemic and seasonal The March baseline factors in the recent jump in energy  prices and that led us to revise our forecast lower for US GDP growth by 02 of a percentage point to 35% this year We nudged up the forecast for GDP growth in 2023 from  3% to 31% The bulk of the downward revision was in the second quarter when real GDP is expected to rise 48% at an  annualized rate compared with the 61% in the February baseline forecast We now expect oil prices to peak in the  second quarter with West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices averaging $100 per barrel Our rule of thumb is that every $10 increase in the per barrel price of oil increases US  retail gasoline prices by 30 cents a gallon Every penny increase in retail gasoline prices reduces consumer spending  by about $15 billion over the course of a year GDP growth in the second half of this year will average 27% at an annualized rate The Bloomberg consensus is for real  GDP to increase 36% this year and 24% in 2023 global supply chain issues remain downside risks to the  near term forecast While inventories played an enormous role in the gain in fourth quarter GDP they are on track along with net exports to be a significant drag on growth  early this year Our high frequency GDP models tracking estimate of first quarter GDP growth keeps heading south  but it has nothing to do with recent geopolitical events Currently first quarter GDP is on track to rise 05% at an  annualized rate Fundamentals have turned less supportive for business investment as corporate credit spreads continue to widen  However corporate profit margins are fairly wide and banks We have real business equipment spending rising 73% this  year compared with 82% in the February baseline The forecast is for real business equipment spending to increase  56% in 2023 a touch stronger than the 54% gain in the Risks are weighted to the downside for nonenergy business investment as financial markets could tighten more than we  anticipate and corporate credit spreads widen further The correlation coefficient between monthly changes in the  high yield corporate bond spread and changes in the S&P 500 is  071 since 2000 The relationship is still strong if we  look at it on a weekly basis Using no and various lags the Granger causality tests showed changes in the S&P 500 caused changes in the high yield corporate bond spread The  causal relationship runs in one direction The real nonresidential structures investment is now expected to increase 144% this year compared with the  11% gain in the February forecast Some of the upward revision is the boost to business investment from higher  energy prices primarily in mining exploration shafts and wells The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses the American Petroleum Institutes weighted average of footage drilled  along with rotary rig counts from Baker Hughes in its current quarter estimate of private fixed investment in  mining exploration shafts and wells This segment now accounts for more than 10% of nominal private fixed investment in nonresidential structures Therefore a rise in  energy prices would lead to an increase in the number of Separately growth in the Commercial Property Price Index  was revised higher it is now expected to increase 86% this year compared with 52% in the February baseline We  raised the forecast next year from 2% to 77% Revisions to housing starts were small Housing starts are expected to be 181 million compared with 184 million in  the February baseline Revisions to housing starts next year were also modest Risks are heavily weighted to the downside There are likely only so many homes that can be  built each year because of labor supply constraints and lack of buildable lots Some of the labor supply issues will ease  as the pandemic winds down but the reduction in immigration is particularly problematic for homebuilders ability to find workers Revisions to the forecast for new   and existing home sales this year were minor as mortgage rates havent risen either fast or high enough to cut  noticeably into sales We nudged up the forecast for the FHFA All Transactions House Price Index this year with it rising 115% compared  with 98% in the February baseline House price growth moderates noticeably in 2023 as prices are forecast to rise 23% a touch weaker than the 24% in the February  baseline This is attributable to rebalancing of supply and The February employment data are incorporated into the March baseline forecast They led to minor tweaks to the  forecast We have job growth averaging 367000 per month this year compared with the February baseline forecast of 384000 There werent material changes to the forecast for  the unemployment rate this year as it is still expected to average 34% in the final three months of this year and  34% in the fourth quarter of next year We assume a full employment economy is one with a 35% unemployment rate around a 625% labor force  participation rate and an 80% prime age employment to  population ratio All of these conditions will be met by late this year or early next Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was explicit during his semiannual testimony to the House Committee on Financial  Services He took away all uncertainty about the outcome of throwing his support behind a 25 basis point rate hike and  saying that plans to reduce the size of the balance sheet will Normally Fed chairs avoid tipping their hands as it could be  seen as front running the FOMC  However Russias invasion of Ukraine has caused a lot of volatility in financial markets and created new uncertainty Therefore Powell likely  wanted to reduce any uncertainty about the Feds intention at its upcoming meeting Powell did leave the door open for  larger rate hikes at future meetings He sounded optimistic that the Fed can engineer a soft landing where it raises interest rates enough to curb  inflation but not enough to tip the economy into recession Powell floated the idea that this tightening cycle will end above his estimate of the neutral fed funds rate of 2% to  25% We maintained our assumption that the Fed raises the target range for the fed funds rate four times this year 25  basis points each time Markets are pricing in more hikes just south of seven hikes over the next 12 months The  tightening in financial market conditions did some of the Feds work for it The primary channel through which monetary policy impacts the economy is financial markets  With financial market conditions tightening the Fed doesnt need to do as much this year The Fed is also expected to begin quantitative tightening  this summer That is the central bank will not replace the Treasury and mortgage securities it owns as they mature or prepay allowing its balance sheet to slowly shrink and  putting upward pressure on longer term rates Risks are weighted toward more rate hikes this year Higher energy prices are going to cause inflation to peak higher  than we had previously expected We look for year over  year growth in the consumer price index to be 74% in the  first quarter compared with 7% in the February baseline The inflation forecast follows a similar trajectory as past baseline forecasts just higher Inflation moderates through  the remainder of the year returning to the Feds target in the first half of next year Key to this forecast is that oil  prices average $100 per barrel in the second quarter with that being the peak Also supply chain issues are expected to ease leading to significant disinflation in goods prices We didnt make significant changes to the forecast for the 10 year Treasury yield The forecast is that the Dow Jones Industrial Average incorporates the recent developments  The new baseline will have the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower than its February baseline The recent decline  accounted for the bulk of the decline we expected to occur throughout the year Therefore the March baseline has another leg lower in equity prices which we expect will  remain within a tight range through the end of next year Inflation in the euro zone hit a record high in February at  59% year over year Energy prices remained the key mover in the release although prices increased considerably for  food and core goods as well Unfortunately price pressures will continue heating up in March as the military conflict in Ukraine has further shocked energy and nonenergy  commodity prices For most of February the story was about oil prices as Brent crude prices rose significantly across the month This  boosted electricity prices and prices at the pump Meanwhile rising production costs resulting from supply  chain disruptions and soaring energy bills were behind the price increases of core industrial goods particularly those of personal vehicles and furniture and household appliances  Such durable goods have been under immense pressure given more than a year of sky high shipping rates and acute  shortages of key inputs in global markets Clothing and footwear price inflation rebounded in February which did a lot to support core inflation But here it is less a story of  robust demand or tight supply although we do expect demand for clothing to recover in step with the abatement  of the pandemic Rather there are also some base effects at work Finally services inflation remained moderate in  comparison this February with prices rising only 01% m/m Part of the reason is that the sector was still stifled by the pandemic and lingering social distancing measures As  demand for traveling is unleashed this spring and summer we should see stronger inflation pressures return to services The Bank of England lifted interest rates by 25 basis points to 075% in its March meeting in line with expectations  The decision was not unanimous one member voted for the status quo given worries over the negative impact that higher commodity prices resulting from the Russia   Ukraine  military conflict will have on purchasing power and growth Rates are back where they were before the start of the  pandemic Unsurprisingly the BoE also raised its inflation forecasts It now expects inflation to peak at 8% in the second quarter as a result of higher prices and supply  disruptions due to the Ukraine military conflict The BoE will raise rates further this year but not as fast as markets  expect given the weaker economic outlook on the back of rate leaving it at 14% Inflation sped up significantly in January and February to 487% year over year and 544%  respectively Global inflation pressures worsened in these months and the drop in the lira made import inflation even  stronger The price environment has negative implications for real consumption and investment The inflation  dynamics call for higher monetary policy rates but we do not expect the central bank to hike rates at the next Global supply chains are under significant strain as the West  deals with the ramifications of the Russia   Ukraine military conflict and the East deals with lockdowns and restrictions associated with COVID 19 Expect freight rates delivery  delays and import prices to rise in the near term No rest for the weary Before the surge of the Omicron variant of COVID 19 at the  start of the year in the western hemisphere there had been signs that supply chain stresses could be waning and a return to normal could be on the horizon Freight rates and  container costs started to come down before Omicron started surging in the West in January and by February had  them rising again Given the inelastic nature of shipping supply and port equipment at the worlds disposal any disruption to the logistical flow of goods and services owing  to these external forces are bound to derail already impaired The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has since  replaced the Omicron variant as the leading source of supply chain stress in the West as COVID 19 numbers have  come down and travel and mobility restrictions lifted Not only has the conflict been a source of direct disruption to policies and sanctions that have been introduced since the  start of the conflict have forced carriers to reroute operations and carry less freight between the eastern and  western hemispheres While the Omicron wave has subsided in the West it is still raging in many places in the East China saw its largest number of cases in a single day since the start of the pandemic on Monday and has now put more than 50 million residents in various cities across the country under lockdown to contain the crisis Hong Kong  which has seen been hard pressed to contain the spread of the virus Similarly South Korea is facing its greatest surge in cases yet and as with Hong Kong  has not implemented a full scale lockdown accepting the reality of living with COVID 19 as Japan is coming off its Omicron peak and is considering lifting mobility restrictions next week Malaysia  Singapore    Thailand and Indonesia are also coming off Omicron peaks and have likewise indicated their intention to live with  COVID 19 rather than impose stronger restrictions and What this means for global supply chains Much will hinge on what happens in China  Most of the other countries have largely tried to keep things business as  precautionary measures China so far has instituted short  succeeded in quashing any clusters that have formed in different parts of the country While locally disruptive this does not have substantial impact to global supply chains if the lockdowns remain localized and do not stay on for an Valley is under lockdown for a week even as its key port of  Yantain remains open It remains to be seen whether these ports that are critical to the global logistics network will remain open if the growth in COVID 19 cases in China  continues A weeklong lockdown in Shenzhen  while detrimental to the local economy does not impact global  supply chains nearly as much as the long term closure of key ports like Shanghai  Yantian or Ningbo  Any pause in  production due to the weeklong shutdown such as in can be made up for by redirecting production to other sites  while important port closures would keep containers stuck in those ports at a time when there is a serious dearth in  available shipping material and capacity Although the global supply chain picture is clouded with uncertainty we can expect to see continued stress in the system in the next few months Energy prices and key commodity prices are likely to remain elevated if the military conflict continues and this will feed into higher are all impeding the flow of goods and services worldwide Some industries will be at greater risk than others  particularly those reliant on highly integrated global supply chains Time is the all important factor in whether these recent events—the military conflict and the Omicron  surge—will have a devastating effect on global supply chains Short term disruptions can be mitigated with  creative sourcing and inventory management but a drawn  out affair would make it much harder for supply chains to last week with upgrades accounting for nearly three fourths of total activity and more than 90% of affected debt Rating change activity was split across a broad range of industries with speculative grade companies representing most of the changes  The largest upgrade in terms of affected debt was made to Uber Technologies Inc which saw its Corporate Family Rating upgraded to B1 and its senior secured loan and senior unsecured debt rating upgraded to Ba3 and B2 respectively analyst Raj Joshi said “The upgrade of the CFR to B1 reflects a significant turnaround in Ubers adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2021 and our expectations for rapid and flow over the next 12 to 24 months” In total the upgrade number of downgrades last week with most changes  stemming from Moodys Investors Services downgrade of the rating for 95 Russian nonfinancial corporates For the  week ended March 15 there were a total of 31 downgrades and one upgrade Ireland led all countries recording 16 firms with rating changes followed by Cyprus  which saw six  changes The Netherlands  Switzerland and the UK each saw two firms receive rating changes while Spain and   Austria each recorded one Moodys Investors Services downgrades of nonfinancial Russian corporate ratings  follows the downgrade on March 6 of the
