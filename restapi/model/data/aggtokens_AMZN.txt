Mountain View-based Willow Innovation launches new wearable breast pump Will be right back Thank you for your patience Our engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue Amazon faces high-stakes Alabama union vote after 'radically different' campaign Vote tallying began on Monday in a historic union election at an Amazon AMZN warehouse in Bessemer Alabama where a labor victory among more than 5000 workers could upend the business model at the e commerce giant and intensify a surge of organizing underway at major companies like Starbucks SBUX and Disney DIS The election arrives roughly one year after the overwhelming defeat of an initial union drive led by the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union RWDSU at the Bessemer facility — a result that was later nullified by a ruling that Amazon had illegally interfered with the labor campaign Alongside the revote in Bessemer warehouse workers at a 6000 person facility on Staten Island are casting their ballots in a union election that ends on Wednesday Both elections could deliver results by the end of the week with victories dealing a sudden and significant blow to Amazon which has opposed the labor campaigns at both facilities But twin union defeats could tarnish the perception of organizing at the company nationwide discouraging workers beyond Amazon and affirming the companys previous contention that criticism of the work environment at its warehouses is overblown RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum as well as pro union Amazon workers told Yahoo Finance that a different strategy and a new set of grievances have energized the campaign feeding optimism that the union will prevail in the second election at the plant Labor experts acknowledged the significance of a potential victory at the nations second largest employer especially among a predominantly Black segment of its workforce at a facility in the labor unfriendly South Moreover the election at Amazon coincides with a nationwide wave of organizing as emboldened workers draw leverage from a tight labor market Starbucks workers in recent months have unionized eight stores with more likely to come as over 100 stores across more than 25 states have filed for union elections and employees at Disney captured attention last week with a walkout to protest the companys posture toward a controversial Florida law But the experts cautioned that the bottomless resources and anti union messaging of a corporate giant like Amazon makes the organizing drive a difficult feat The election is “symbolic because Amazon is sort of looked at as the wave of the future in terms of the business world the globalized economy and the high tech economy” says Paul Clark a labor relations professor at Pennsylvania State University “There was a great disappointment when the first vote was not even close so this would be a big deal” In a statement to Yahoo Finance Amazon said it eagerly awaits the results of the union election in Bessemer “We look forward to having our employees voices heard” spokesperson Kelly Nantel said “Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work” Dale Wyatt a warehouse worker at the Bessemer facility since August said he voted “yes” for the union because it would bring job security a potential pay raise and bolstered workplace safety protections “Amazon has 100% of the power right now” says Wyatt who makes $1605 per hour “They can fire us at any time With a union thats not how it works We have a representative to protect us” The criticism echoes grievances voiced by Amazon workers for years including during the previous organizing drive at the Bessemer facility when workers said they endured grueling and dangerous conditions enforced by digital devices that track them every minute Some workers also say these devices fuel high turnover as the company fires employees who fail to keep up with performance quotas Emergency calls from the facility in recent months suggest incidents of acute difficulty Individuals at the Bessemer warehouse called 911 a total of 32 times over the first two months of 2022 amounting to a rate of more than one call every two days according to a 911 call log obtained by Yahoo Finance through a public records request The reasons for the calls included heart attacks psychiatric problems and fainting the 911 log said The facility has thousands of workers there but thats still a lot of calls says Joshua Freeman a professor emeritus of labor history at Queens College at the City University of New York It clearly reflects some challenging conditions Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about the 911 calls Wyatt said the second union drive in Bessemer has also focused on a newfound disillusionment at the warehouse: a belief that the company has fallen short of a commitment to improve employee relations made during the first union drive last spring Ive noticed a lot of people who were voting ‘no last time are voting ‘yes this time because Amazon didnt follow through on its promises from the last round Wyatt said In a previous statement to Yahoo Finance Amazon defended its commitment to workers wellbeing and safety Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees the company said We are anything but complacent and continue to innovate learn and improve the measures we have in place to protect our teams” A number of workers at the facility in Bessemer oppose the union drive in part because they fear the loss of what they consider strong pay and benefits BuzzFeed News reported last month Full time entry level employees for the company in Alabama make nearly $16 per hour — a pay rate over twice the federal minimum wage “Im very worried about what would happen should the union be voted in Kylee Rancour an Amazon warehouse worker in Bessemer told BuzzFeed News It could mean sacrificing benefits in exchange for things we dont want or need Meanwhile in advocating for the union Wyatt has spoken with colleagues about it in the break room helped hand out union provided goodie bags and even made a homemade T shirt that says in part Your boss lied Its all part of a revamped union strategy that favors person to person conversations with workers That contrasts with the organizing drive last year which appeared to focus on attracting big name supporters like President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders I VT “This is radically different from the first campaign says Appelbaum the RWDSU president He says the campaign has drawn support and in some cases personnel from 20 other unions which allowed for up to 150 organizers on the ground in Bessemer at any given time Among the partner unions are two of the nations largest the Service Employees International Union and the Teamsters the latter of which launched its own nationwide campaign focused on Amazon last June But the second organizing drive at Bessemer has faced a staunch and well resourced anti union campaign from Amazon Wyatt and Appelbaum said For his part Wyatt estimated that he had been forced to attend at least 12 meetings in recent months during which Amazon attempted to persuade workers to oppose the union Over the days leading up to mail in voting which began on Feb 4 Wyatt received daily messages from Amazon urging him to vote no he said To be sure federal labor law permits employers wide latitude in dissuading workers from supporting a labor drive including mandatory meetings with employees “One thing that has stayed the same is Amazon has been conducting a ferocious union busting campaign just as they did during the first vote Appelbaum said Amazon previously provided the following statement to Yahoo Finance regarding other union campaigns among its employees: Its our employees choice whether or not to join a union It always has been And its important that everyone understands the facts about joining a union and the election process itself We host regular information sessions for all employees which includes an opportunity for them to ask questions the statement continues If the union vote passes it will impact everyone at the site so its important all employees understand what that means for them and their day to day life working at Amazon” Maite Tapia a labor expert at Michigan State University noted that the anti union tactics carried out by Amazon comprise the standard response to unionization from many large employers including Starbucks another major brand publicly opposing an organizing effort undertaken by its workers Im hopeful but at the same time they fight against corporations that have bottomless pockets when it comes to anti union campaigning she says In the Bessemer warehouse workers conditions are inextricably linked to issues of race surveillance and policing as about 80% of the warehouses workforce is Black said Tamara Lee a labor expert at Rutgers University who often collaborates with Tapia Amazon says that the tracking devices allow the company to enhance the safety and efficiency of the workplace “Like any business we use technology to maintain a level of security within our operations to help keep our employees buildings and inventory safe — it would be irresponsible if we didnt do so” the company told the Washington Post in December “Its also important to note that while the technology helps keep our employees safe it also allows them to be more efficient in their jobs the company added Lee pointed to the negative ramifications of rigorously tracking worker performance “With this kind of nonstop surveillance its a form of bodily control inside and outside the workplace especially Black bodies that make up the majority of the workforce in Bessemer” she said Its very significant that this is happening now and that its happening in the South but I dont want to overplay this moment she adds Workers have been frustrated at Amazon for years and theyve made other attempts to organize” For years Amazon has withstood persistent criticism over the conditions at its warehouse network which has grown to at least 110 fulfillment centers in North America The company instituted a $15 wage floor four years ago and last year backed legislation that would gradually raise the federal minimum wage from $725 to $15 per hour Other companies like Ben & Jerrys and Patagonia are among the firms that support a $15 minimum wage But national interest in the first Bessemer union drive spurred more than 1000 Amazon employees across the US to contact RWDSU about potential labor organizing efforts the union said last March Natalie Monarrez a warehouse worker at a Staten Island facility thats in a union drive of its own said she hopes the second election in Bessemer brings a sea change in worker relations at the company and other major firms Jeff Bezos already had 27 years to figure it out and it was an afterthought for him she says referring to the founder and former CEO who still chairs the board He shouldve considered his workers even a fraction as much as hes been obsessed with his customers We were inspired by them to unionize and hopefully other locations and workers at other companies will be inspired she adds Max Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance Find him on twitter @MaxZahn_ Allie Garfinkle is a senior tech reporter at Yahoo

Coinbase NASDAQ:COIN is the largest publicly traded crypto specific exchange in the US according to Market Watch They have over 68 million verified users which trade approximately $462 billion in crypto volume! This makes Coinbase the 13th most popular exchange in the world according to Statista Binance is the number one most popular exchange in terms of number of users but Binance isnt public yet Coinbase was a crypto exchange pioneer Founded in 2012 they were one of the first easy to use and trustworthy crypto exchanges Binance launched five years later in 2017• None Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with COIN Click here to check it out• None The intrinsic value of COIN Coinbase enables investors to trade over 140 various crypto assets which include Bitcoin Ethereum Cardano and even Dogecoin The firm makes the majority of revenue from Order Flow and the buy/sell spread from retail and institutional investor trading They charge a spread of approximately 05% for all transactions in addition to fees of $099 As Coinbases revenue is primarily derived from the trading of cryptocurrency mostly by the retail investors this leads to very volatile income Thus to diversify the companys product offerings and grow further Coinbase is investing heavily spending approximately 7% of revenues in fiscal 2022 to build the crypto economy For example the firm has recently announced the launch of Coinbase NFT a peer to peer marketplace that will make minting purchasing showcasing and discovering NFTs easier than ever As Coinbase has 68 million verified users this offers a powerful opportunity for the brand In the meantime the company has a waiting list up where users can sign up Personally I think this is a great idea but I believe Coinbase is slow off the mark An analysis of Google Trends shows searches for NFT peaked in January 2022 As a speculative asset similar to crypto the importance of being an early platform which enables adopters is vital as Coinbase will know However its late entry might have been to avoid association with the early pump and dump money laundering schemes that plagued the NFT space last year As a personal example during the first major talk of NFTs in 2021 I signed up for Opensea since it is the worlds largest NFT marketplace which was recently valued at a monster $13 billion Now although I believe the popularity of NFTs will resurface I would have liked to see Coinbase move faster to create a platform The only positive is the market potential is huge as OpenSea is valued at approximately a third of Coinbases current market cap In the near term Coinbase has introduced a variety of other new products which expand the crypto economy These include the following: Bitcoin Borrow which allows users to borrow money using Bitcoin as collateral Coinbase Card from Visa which allows users to spend their cryptocurrency on everyday purchases and Coinbase Cloud a cloud product which allows decentralized applications to be built on top offering a similar vision to a mini Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN Web Services Coinbase achieved an incredible $78 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2021 up a meteoric 530% year over year This also included a strong operating profit of $3 billion These were incredible numbers and left the company with a strong balance sheet of $71 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to just $3 billion in long term debt Now if the company can keep these numbers up the valuation could someday be approximately five times what it is today by my estimates However there is an issue: Coinbase makes the majority of its revenue from the retail trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum Both of these assets had tremendous bull runs in 2020 and 2021 For example the Bitcoin price skyrocketed by 900% at its peak in November 2021 from lows in March 2020 However the Bitcoin price is now down 24% from its peak in November 2021 I consider myself to be very in touch with the retail investing community since I am a member of it From what Ive seen many retail investors tend to look for the newer coins to trade Cardano Shiba etc which isnt great news for Coinbases main revenue generator Although Coinbase has introduced the ability to buy these newer coins this wasnt until late 2022 which was behind the curve compared with other platforms A lot of crypto traders are short term traders looking to profit off of the next big thing Thus Coinbases guidance is muted for the first quarter of 2022 with the company predicting lower subscriptions and services revenues than in the fourth quarter of 2021 They expect the annual average retail MTUs to be between 5 million and 15 million which is a large and inaccurate range In addition they expect the average transaction revenue per user to decline to pre 2021 levels Perhaps the company is sandbagging for some surprise results but given the revenues are tied heavily to the trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum I think these revenues would make sense Despite the muted expectations for 2022 Coinbase is a holding in the portfolio of Catherine Wood Trades Portfolio of Ark Invest a firm which invests into disruptive technology Woods firm purchased 2000 shares worth of call options for the stock in the fourth quarter of 2021 in addition to the 53 million common stock shares that it holds However it should be noted Wood did reduce her position in the common stock by 22% in the fourth quarter though this may have been due to investor redemptions as the growth focused funds face a period of underperformance Coinbases price sales ratio is just 6 at the moment down from over 20 in 2021 In addition to the slowdown in crypto trading high inflation and rising interest rates have also contributed to the compression of this multiple Coinbase is a fantastic crypto exchange and they are making many investments to build the crypto economy which offers additional optionality value to the stock However as the companys revenue is tied heavily to the popularity and volatility of crypto trading this can be seen as a major risk The stock is cheap on a price sales basis and the financials could rebound strongly if the crypto economy
